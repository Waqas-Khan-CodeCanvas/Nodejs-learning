# 1. Understanding Version 18.8.3

Software versions usually follow a **Major.Minor.Patch** format:

**Version:** 18.8.3

| Part  | Name   | What it means                                                                 |
|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 18    | Major  | Big updates or big changes. For example, new features, big improvements, or changes that might not work with older versions. |
| 8     | Minor  | Small updates or improvements that add features but are usually backward compatible. |
| 3     | Patch  | Tiny fixes like bug fixes, security updates, or minor improvements.           |

**Easy way to remember:**

- **Major →** BIG changes  
- **Minor →** Small upgrades  
- **Patch →** Tiny fixes

# 2. Even-Odd Concept in Version Numbers

Sometimes, software teams use **even and odd numbers** to indicate the stability of a version:

- **Even numbers →** Stable, safe for most users  
  - Example: 18.8.2 → stable
- **Odd numbers →** Experimental or development versions, may have new features but could be unstable  
  - Example: 18.9.1 → might have new stuff but less tested

**So for 18.8.3:**

- **Major: 18 →** Even → Stable  
- **Minor: 8 →** Even → Stable  
- **Patch: 3 →** Odd → Just a tiny fix (patches don’t usually follow even/odd rules strictly, but some teams do)

---

 **Summary:**

- **18.8.3 →** Major 18, Minor 8, Patch 3  
- Major and Minor are stable (even numbers)  
- Patch 3 is a small fix  
- Even numbers = stable, Odd numbers = experimental
